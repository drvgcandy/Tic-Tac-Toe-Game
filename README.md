# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This is a simple command-line interface (CLI) based Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented in Java. It supports multiplayer mode, allowing two players to take turns playing against each other.

## Introduction

This project is a part of my Java practice journey. I developed this game to reinforce my understanding of core Java concepts such as arrays, loops, conditional statements, and user input/output handling.

## Features

- **Multiplayer Mode:** Two players can take turns playing on the same terminal.
- **Simple CLI Interface:** Players are prompted to enter row and column coordinates to make their moves.
- **Win Detection:** The game automatically detects when a player has won or if the game ends in a draw.

## How to Play

1. **Clone or Download:** Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. **Compile:** Compile the `tiktok.java` file using a Java compiler:
3. **Run the Program:** Run the compiled Java program:
4. **Follow On-screen Instructions:** Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game. Each player takes turns entering the row and column coordinates to place their mark ('X' or 'O') on the board.
5. **Game Over:** The game continues until one player wins or the board is filled (resulting in a draw).
